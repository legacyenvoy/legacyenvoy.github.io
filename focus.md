subtitle: What kind of business I'm looking for
---

Although open to any compelling opportunity, I am mainly looking to purchase a product company specializing in physical or digital/SaaS offerings with strong marketing and sales processes in need of operational savvy, generating between $250,000 and $500,000 in Seller's Discretionary Earnings ([SDE](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/sde-sellers-discretionary-earnings/){:target="_blank" title="Definition and calculator"}).

(I would prefer a business located in the general DC/Baltimore area but geography is not a major limiter, nor is the particular industry.)

I am not a "tire kicker" or ultra-conservative investor looking for the perfectly safe bet. I'm looking for reasons to say "yes" and work with you towards continuing the hard-earned legacy you've built. As a motivated buyer I hope to work with a serious seller who likewise isn't just testing the waters.
